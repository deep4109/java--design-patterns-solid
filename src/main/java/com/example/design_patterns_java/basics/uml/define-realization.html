Realization is also a type of inheritance but for interfaces.
In a realization relationship, one entity (normally an interface)
defines a set of functionalities as a contract and the other entity
(normally a class) realizes the contract by implementing the functionality defined in the contract.

interface Payment {
void pay(double amount);
}

// Class implementing the Payment interface
class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
public void pay(double amount) {
System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using credit card.");
}
}

// Main class
public class RealizationExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Payment payment = new CreditCardPayment();
payment.pay(100.0);  // Output: Paid $100.0 using credit card.
}
}
